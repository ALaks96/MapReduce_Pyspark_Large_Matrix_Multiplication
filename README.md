# MapReduce Pyspark Large Matrix Multiplication

This project was part of the final exam for my Database Management course in Ecole Polytechnique. 

We were tasked to develop two programs to do large scale multiplication in both Python MapReduce and Pyspark. We were then asked to benchmark and confront the advantages & incoveniences of the methods we implemented. 

The explanation of each program can be found in the PDF file which also contains the computation time for each.
